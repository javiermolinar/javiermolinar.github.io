#   Working with threads

```cs
var thread = new Thread(() => result = ReadDataFromIO());
// Start the thread
thread.Start();
// Save the result of the calculation into another variable
double result2 = DoIntensiveCalculations();
// Wait for the thread to finish
thread.Join();
```
Create new threads consume too much resources, is a better idea use threads from the thread pool.

**
**All threads created are foreground threads, that can be set to background ones. The system will wait until all foreground threads finish**


#   Threads and threadpool

In .NET there is a class called System.Threading.ThreadPool used when you want to work with threads from the thread pool.

## ThreadPool useful methods

-   QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallback callBack):  Adds a request for execution to the thread pool queue.If there are available threads in the thread pool, then the request will execute right away.

```cs
public delegate void WaitCallback(
	object state //An object containing information to be used by the callback method.
)


public static void Main() {
        // Queue the task.
        ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(ThreadProc));

        Console.WriteLine("Main thread does some work, then sleeps.");
        // If you comment out the Sleep, the main thread exits before
        // the thread pool task runs.  The thread pool uses background
        // threads, which do not keep the application running.  (This
        // is a simple example of a race condition.)
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.WriteLine("Main thread exits.");
    }

    // This thread procedure performs the task.
    static void ThreadProc(Object stateInfo) {
        // No state object was passed to QueueUserWorkItem, so 
        // stateInfo is null.
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from the thread pool.");
    }
}

```

-   **All the threads from the threadpool are background threads. Meaning that CLR won´t wait until finish.**

-   You can’t abort or interrupt a thread from the thread pool.

-   You can’t control the priority of a thread from the thread pool.

## BackgroundWorker

Make it easier work with threads.

## Working with the Task Parallel Library

### Introducing Task

Task, represents an asyncronous operation. There are two task classes: **Task** and **Task<result>**

Useful methods:

-   ContinueWith:   Create a new task that will be started when the current task complete.

-   Run:    Add a request for work on the thread pool and it returns a Task object.

-   Start:  Start the task.

-   Wait:   Waits for the task represented by this instance.

-   WaitAll,WaitAny.

-   WhenAll, WhenAny. Similar to Wait but it returns a new task.

-   Result: Get the value returned by the async operation.

### How to create a task

-   Create an instance of task, it needs to call start before create it.

-   TaskFactory.StartNew

-   Task.Run, is a wrapper of TaskFactory.StartNew

-   With a continuation method, WhenAll, WhenAny, ContinueWith...

### Continuations

```cs
public Task ContinueWith(
	Action<Task, object> continuationAction,
	object state
)

public Task ContinueWith(
	Action<Task, object> continuationAction,
	object state,
	CancellationToken cancellationToken
)

public Task ContinueWith(
	Action<Task> continuationAction,
	TaskContinuationOptions continuationOptions
)

```

### TaskContinuationOptions

-   ExecuteSynchronously

-   LongRunning

-   OnlyOnCanceled //Specifies that the continuation should be scheduled only if its antecedent was canceled

-   OnlyOnFaulted //pecifies that the continuation task should be scheduled only if its antecedent threw an unhandled exception.

## Using the Parallel Class

System.Threading.Tasks namespace. This class has three static methods:

-   For //For Similar to a for loop but iterations may run in parallel. Can accept a ParallelOptions parameter or ParallelLoopState to control the loop.

-   Foreach

-   Invoke //This method will attempt to run the provided actions in parallel. Accepting an array of Actions delegates to execute.

```cs
// Method signature: Parallel.ForEach(IEnumerable<TSource> source, Action<TSource> body)

Parallel.ForEach(files, (currentFile) => 
                        {   
                            Console.WriteLine("Processing {0} on thread {1}", filename, Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
                        });
```
