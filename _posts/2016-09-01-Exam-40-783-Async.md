#   Working with threads

```cs
var thread = new Thread(() => result = ReadDataFromIO());
// Start the thread
thread.Start();
// Save the result of the calculation into another variable
double result2 = DoIntensiveCalculations();
// Wait for the thread to finish
thread.Join();
```
Create new threads consume too much resources, is a better idea use threads from the thread pool.

**
**All threads created are foreground threads, that can be set to background ones. The system will wait until all foreground threads finish**


#   Threads and threadpool

In .NET there is a class called System.Threading.ThreadPool used when you want to work with threads from the thread pool.

## History

.Net 1

```cs
//Create a new foreground thread
 var thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(LongRunningProcess));

//Use a thread from the threadpool
ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(LongRunningProcess));
```

.Net 2

```cs
this.backgroundWorker = new BackgroundWorker();

// Subscribe to events
this.backgroundWorker.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler(IntensiveProcess);
this.backgroundWorker.ProgressChanged += new ProgressChangedEventHandler(UpdateTheUI);
this.backgroundWorker.RunWorkerCompleted += new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler(JobDone);

// Set worker to enable progress reporting and cancellation.
this.backgroundWorker.WorkerReportsProgress = true;
this.backgroundWorker.WorkerSupportsCancellation = true;

// Run the worker task asynchronously.
this.backgroundWorker.RunWorkerAsync();
```

.Net 3

Introduced the System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher class which manages processing within a WPF application and which allows the UI to be updated by a non-UI thread.

If a thread is processing a long running operation and wishes to update the UI upon completion, for example, then the Dispatcher must be used to perform that update which will queue the updates on the UI thread.  If the Dispatcher is not used then an InvalidOperationException will be raised.

```cs
// Start processing on a thread and use the dispatcher to update the UI.
var thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(() =>
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    {
        Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Normal, new Action(() =>
        {
            textBlock1.Text = i.ToString();
        }));
    }
}
));
 
thread.Start();
```

.Net 4

PLINQ is an implementation of LINQ which will execute a LINQ query in parallel, if possible.

```cs
public void PlinqExample()
{
    int[] data = Enumerable.Range(1, 1000000).ToArray();
 
    var result = (from num in data.AsParallel()
                  where num % 7 == 0
                  orderby num descending
                  select num).ToArray();
 
    TextBox1.Text = string.Format("{0} numbers found!", result.Count());
}
```
.NET 4.0 also introduced the Task Parallel Library (TPL) which is essentially a collection of classes which abstracts away threads, essentially simplifying asynchronous programming as you don’t need to work with threads or the ThreadPool, for example.

A task can be created and started by:

-   creating an instance of Task and calling its Start method

-   calling an overload of TaskFactory.StartNew

-   calling an overload of Task.Run (which is a simple wrapper of TaskFactory.StartNew)

-   calling one of the continuation methods, Task.WhenAll, Task.WhenAny, TaskFactory.ContinueWhenAll or TaskFactory.ContinueWhenAny.

```cs
public void TaskExample()
{
    List<Task> tasks = new List<Task>();
 
    tasks.Add(Task.Factory.StartNew(() => LongRunningProcess("task1")));
    tasks.Add(new Task(new Action(() => { LongRunningProcess("task2"); })));
    tasks[1].Start();
 
    Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());
}
```

.NET 4.5

```cs
public async void AsyncAwaitExample()
{
   this.Output.Text = await DoSomethingASync();
}
 
// Use of async and await not necessary here but best practice
private async Task<string> DoSomethingASync()
{
    return await Task.Run(() =>
    {
    Thread.Sleep(500);
    return "I'm done!";
    });
}
 ```

## ThreadPool useful methods

-   QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallback callBack):  Adds a request for execution to the thread pool queue.If there are available threads in the thread pool, then the request will execute right away.

```cs
public delegate void WaitCallback(
	object state //An object containing information to be used by the callback method.
)


public static void Main() {
        // Queue the task.
        ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(ThreadProc));

        Console.WriteLine("Main thread does some work, then sleeps.");
        // If you comment out the Sleep, the main thread exits before
        // the thread pool task runs.  The thread pool uses background
        // threads, which do not keep the application running.  (This
        // is a simple example of a race condition.)
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.WriteLine("Main thread exits.");
    }

    // This thread procedure performs the task.
    static void ThreadProc(Object stateInfo) {
        // No state object was passed to QueueUserWorkItem, so 
        // stateInfo is null.
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from the thread pool.");
    }
}

```

-   **All the threads from the threadpool are background threads. Meaning that CLR won´t wait until finish.**

-   You can’t abort or interrupt a thread from the thread pool.

-   You can’t control the priority of a thread from the thread pool.

## BackgroundWorker

Make it easier work with threads.

## Working with the Task Parallel Library

### Introducing Task

Task, represents an asyncronous operation. There are two task classes: **Task** and **Task<result>**

Useful methods:

-   ContinueWith:   Create a new task that will be started when the current task complete.

-   Run:    Add a request for work on the thread pool and it returns a Task object.

-   Start:  Start the task.

-   Wait:   Waits for the task represented by this instance.

-   WaitAll,WaitAny.

-   WhenAll, WhenAny. Similar to Wait but it returns a new task.

-   Result: Get the value returned by the async operation.

### How to create a task

-   Create an instance of task, it needs to call start before create it.

-   TaskFactory.StartNew

-   Task.Run, is a wrapper of TaskFactory.StartNew

-   With a continuation method, WhenAll, WhenAny, ContinueWith...

### Continuations

```cs
public Task ContinueWith(
	Action<Task, object> continuationAction,
	object state
)

public Task ContinueWith(
	Action<Task, object> continuationAction,
	object state,
	CancellationToken cancellationToken
)

public Task ContinueWith(
	Action<Task> continuationAction,
	TaskContinuationOptions continuationOptions
)

```

### TaskContinuationOptions

-   ExecuteSynchronously

-   LongRunning

-   OnlyOnCanceled //Specifies that the continuation should be scheduled only if its antecedent was canceled

-   OnlyOnFaulted //pecifies that the continuation task should be scheduled only if its antecedent threw an unhandled exception.

## Using the Parallel Class

System.Threading.Tasks namespace. This class has three static methods:

-   For //For Similar to a for loop but iterations may run in parallel. Can accept a ParallelOptions parameter or ParallelLoopState to control the loop.

-   Foreach

-   Invoke //This method will attempt to run the provided actions in parallel. Accepting an array of Actions delegates to execute.

```cs
// Method signature: Parallel.ForEach(IEnumerable<TSource> source, Action<TSource> body)

Parallel.ForEach(files, (currentFile) => 
                        {   
                            Console.WriteLine("Processing {0} on thread {1}", filename, Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
                        });
```


## Working with cancellations

The cancellations provided in .NET are cooperative cancellations, meaning that you can send a cancellation request to another thread, or task,
but it is their choice to honor the request. 

Cancellation capabilities are implemented using one class: CancellationTokenSource.

One struct, CancellationToken.

1. If a thread wants to have the capability to cancel subsequent operations, it creates a **CancellationTokenSource** object.

2. When a cancellable asynchronous operation starts, the calling thread passes a
CancellationToken.

3. If the parent thread wants to cancel the ongoing cancelable operations, it calls Cancel on the
CancellationTokenSource object.

4. All ongoing operations might use the CancelationToken sent as a parameter to check if a
cancellation is pending and respond accordingly. Note that ignoring the cancellation request
is a perfect valid option.

```cs
public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      // Create the token source.
      CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

      // Pass the token to the cancelable operation.
      ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(DoSomeWork), cts.Token);
      Thread.Sleep(2500);

      // Request cancellation.
      cts.Cancel();
      
      //The token has to be disposed
      cts.Dispose();
   }

   // Thread 2: The listener
   static void DoSomeWork(object obj)
   {
      CancellationToken token = (CancellationToken)obj;

      for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
         if (token.IsCancellationRequested)
         {
            Console.WriteLine("In iteration {0}, cancellation has been requested...",
                              i + 1);
            // Perform cleanup if necessary.
            //...
            // Terminate the operation.
            break;
         }        
      }
   }
}
```
