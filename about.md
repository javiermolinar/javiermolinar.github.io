Iâ€™m full stack software developer and SCRUM master with more than 6 years of experience in the software industry, currently working at Unit4, based in Granada.
I have very good knowledge of Microsoft environments, including C#, .Net, SQL Server, and Azure platform.
Passionate about technology in general and programming in particular; I keep myself informed about latest trends and news, and always working to keep myself updated.
I'm interested on methodologies and good practices to deliver quality code and cutting-edge technologies that I could use to improve my daily work. 
In my spare time I like to design, program and solve classic cryptographic algorithms; apart from others projects that come to my mind.
I really enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams, doing mentoring and be mentored as well.
